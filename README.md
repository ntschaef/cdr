# Constructive Dialog Rules

Version 1.0

The _constructive dialog rules_ mean that comments:

1. must be relevant to the original post or to the specific topic under discussion,
2. must refrain from personal attacks, and
3. should supply evidence or sources for any assertions.

Comments that do not meet the rules are subject to deletion.

Like the rules?  Use them!  Don't like the rules?  Change them!  You can change them by either submitting a pull request or by forking this repository.

Semantic versioning is used here.  This is interpreted as: changes that would not change the disposition of comments increment the minor number.  Breaking changes increment the major number.  See https://semver.org/.
